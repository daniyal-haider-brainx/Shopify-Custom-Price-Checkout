Simply slide the bracket out, screw it to the studs in your wall (making sure it is level), slide the shelf onto the bracket, and screw the shelf into the bracket from the top.

            "answer": "<p>Each shelf comes with a non dimmable driver so you may wire the shelf directly to standard 110-120VAC power. Simply install the shelf bracket, slide the shelf onto the bracket, and connect the two wires from the shelf driver to the 2 wires coming out from your wall (these wires will need to be ran by your electrician from your power source to the shelf location). Your electrician may install a wall switch to allow easy control of power to all the shelves in your install at once.<\/p>"
